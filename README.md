**Ps** is a simple CLI tool written in Golang for messing around with processes running on your machine. With this tool, you can have all running processes on your machine displayed in the terminal in a tabular form, view select processes & kill them.
This project is heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/gwuah/go-process-killer)!
